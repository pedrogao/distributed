## 笔记

- 准备阶段 Prepare 不需要携带提议值，只需携带提议编号即可；
- 由于之前没有通过任何提案，所以节点 A、B 将返回一个 “尚无提案”的响应。  
  也就是说节点 A 和 B 在告诉提议者，我之前没有通过任何提案呢，并承诺以后不再响应提案编号小于等于 1 的准备请求，不会通过编号小于 1 的提案。
- 当节点 A、B 收到提案编号为 5 的准备请求的时候，因为提案编号 5 大于它们之前响应的准备请求的提案编号 1，  
  而且两个节点都没有通过任何提案，所以它将返回一个 “尚无提案”的响应，并承诺以后不再响应提案编号小于等于 5 的准备请求，不会通过编号小于 5 的提案。
